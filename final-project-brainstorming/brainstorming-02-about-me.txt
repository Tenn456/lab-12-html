My name is Tenjing Norsang. I am currently a student at the New York College of Technology aiming to earn my Bachelor's degree in Technology. My Major is Emerging Media in the Game Design Concentration. I previously attended Hostos Community College where I earned my Associate's in Applied Science. My goal is to become a Game Designer and make awesome games that people can enjoy. Some things I enjoy doing are playing sports, drawing. and of course playing video games. Some of my favorite games include Spider-Man ps5, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. I hope that my games can create feelings of inspiration and awe in future children as these games gave to me.
